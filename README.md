# Excel Bike Shales Project

## Overview
Took a dataset about Bike sales into Excel and created an interactive dashboard. Process involved first cleaning the data. This step consisted of removing duplicates, using filters to check for correct unique elements, changing cell formats, and using the find & replace feature to change cells to make it more cohesive for the analysis stage. For example, for one of the columns that contained the ages of individuals, I used the find & replace feature to create three seperate groups for ages rather than having ages ranging from 25 to 89. Afterwards, I created three Pivot Tables along with a bar chart and two line graphs. Then I created an interactive dashboard that used slicers for the three graphs to give the option of filtering them by their marital status, education, or region.
